| Huge Output Dual Hatch                            | Similar with `Huge Input Dual Hatch` but with a larger capacity                                                                |
| Huge Steam Input Hatch                            | Like Large Steam Input Hatch . Raise the steam multiblock recipe restriction to **HV** *and* The duration taken becomes **1t** |
| Super Input Dual Hatch                            | Similar to `Huge Input Dual Hatch` , but with more input space                                                                 |
| Spectral Analysis Hatch                           | Enhanced Integrated Ore Processor and Advanced Integrated Ore Processor                                                        |
| Transmutation Bus Hatch                           | Used on Atomic Transmutation Core , Door of Creation and Creative Aggregator                                                   |
| Ventiane Transcription Node                       | Output red stone signal for Catalytic Cascade Array and Reverse Time Boosting Engine                                           |
| Cloud Computation / Research Data Hatch / Machine | More advanced computation / research data systems                                                                              |

In addition, there are also some defiled Part

- `WirelessOpticalDataHatch` *and* `WirelessOpticalComputationHatch` allow Multiblock Machine **sharing**
- `AutoConfigurationMaintenanceHatch` series also allow Multiblock Machine **sharing** *And* There is a slot where different items can be stuffed to obtain different bonuses

### Recipe

- Many simplified recipes have been added, which can help optimize large-scale production lines. Please learn to use **`jei`** to find recipes. If this recipe is added by `GTLAdditions`, there will be a prompt to explain(So you can often look through jei in your daily life. You will always find some new recipes)
- The addition of brand-new SOC chips and wafers enables more efficient circuit production

For further information, please consult the in-game GTLAdditions guide.
